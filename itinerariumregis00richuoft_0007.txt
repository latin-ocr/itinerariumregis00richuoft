INTRODUCTION

THE Itimrarium Reqis Ricardi, from which the following
extracts are taken, is a contemporary account of the Third
Crusade. The author certainly accompanied Richard on
his Journey to Palestine, and was an eyewitness of most
of the events he describes. He was inspired with a sincere
enthusiasm for the Crusading cause, and with an admira-
tion of Richard's exploits and character. He was probably
Richard, Canon of the Holy Trinity in Aldgate, who was
in the service of the Knights of the Temple.

Attached as he was to Richard’s service, the author,
naturally, was prejudiced against the French 3 and he
shows a contempt for Saladin which is distinctly unfair.

The style of the Itinerarium is deeply influenced by the
Vulqate, and it is a good example of medieval Latin. It is
disfigured by few of the puns‚ false antitheses, and so
forth, to which some medieval authors were addicted, and
the author has a good vocabulary and a regard for the
rules of grammar.

He says of his own work: “ Quod vidimus testamur,
61 res gestas, adhuc calente memoria, stilo duximus desig-
nandas. At si cultiorem dicendi formam deliciosus exposcit

' auditor noverit nos in castris fuisse cum scripsimus; et

bellicos strepitus tranquillae meditationis otium non ad·

misisse.” The work was probably given its final form after
Richard I.’s death.
